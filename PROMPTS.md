I am creating a Javascript SDK for Printify. I will publish it to NPM. Can you walk me through steps to set up rollup to bundle my code before publishing? I also need .npmignore file. I am using typescript too, so it needs to be compatible with that

- my code is stored in src/ folder with .ts files

should I store all type declarations in its own folder "types"? or should I put it adjacent to files in src folder
